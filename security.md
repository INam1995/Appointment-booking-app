# Security Policy 

## Introduction
This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented to protect sensitive data on the Hospital Appointment Booking Website. The security of user data is our top priority, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of our users.

## Data Protection
- **User Data**: We collect and store personal information, including names, contact details, medical history, and appointment details. This information is only used for the purpose of providing appointment services and will not be shared with third parties without user consent.
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS for data in transit, AES for data at rest).

## Access Control
- **User Authentication**: All users must authenticate their identity using strong passwords. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is recommended for added security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to the application is restricted based on user roles. Only authorized personnel can access sensitive information and perform administrative actions.

## Vulnerability Management
- **Regular Audits**: The application undergoes regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- **Security Updates**: We apply security patches and updates to all software components regularly to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response
- **Incident Reporting**: Users can report security incidents or vulnerabilities via our dedicated security email: [security@hospital-website.com](mailto:security@hospital-website.com).
- **Response Plan**: In the event of a security breach, we will notify affected users within 72 hours and provide details about the nature of the breach, potential consequences, and recommended actions.

## Secure Development Practices
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes are subject to peer review to ensure compliance with security best practices.
- **Security Training**: All development team members receive training on secure coding practices and the latest security threats.

## Compliance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: We comply with relevant data protection regulations, including HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), where applicable.
